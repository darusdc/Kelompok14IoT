At this final project we are build device that can turn on your lamp and fan when it's needed.

For example today is hot, the temperature is higher than 30 C then the fan or AC will be turn on

also when it's dark your room is lack of highlight the lamp will automatically turn on. Not just that

you also can control the condition that fit with you or you can manually turn on your lamp or fan/ac manually by your phone.

So dont need to wake up from your bed or back to home when you are not!
